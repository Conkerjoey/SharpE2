# SharpE2
This is a C# expression engine. The engine can convert string based simple mathematical expression to a value or a simplified expression.

This library is lightweight as it is under 20 ko.

This class library works as follow:

"1 + 2 + 3" = "6"

"2 * 10 % 3" = "2"

# Installation
### Using Visual Studio

```csharp
E2Simplifier simplifier = new E2Simplifier();

string output = simplifier.Simplify("5 + 6 * 3 + 5 ^ 5");

/* output will be 3148 as a string */
```
